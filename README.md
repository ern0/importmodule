# importmodule
Finally, I've also wrote a Python3 module import wrapper.

I don't understand the concept behind Python3 __import__(). I think there should be a function, which returns the module ready-to-use, from the filename passed as parameter. I've failed to find such, so I have just wrote mine. 

Usage: see example.py
